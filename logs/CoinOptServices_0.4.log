[model] Performance warnings
WARNING: The addition operator has been used on JuMP expressions a large number of times. This warning is safe to ignore but may indicate that model generation is slower than necessary. For performance reasons, you should not add expressions in a loop. Instead of x += y, use append!(x,y) to modify x in place. If y is a single variable, you may also use push!(x, coef, y) in place of x += coef*y.

WARNING: in @NLexpression(quadexpr2,x + x ^ 2 + x * y + y ^ 2): three arguments are required.
Note that the syntax of @NLexpression has recently changed:
The first argument should be the model to which the expression is attached.
The second is the name of the expression (or collection of expressions).
The third is the expression itself.
Example:
@NLexpression(m, my_expr, x^2/y)
@NLexpression(m, my_expr_collection[i=1:2], sin(z[i])^2)
Support for the old syntax (with the model omitted) will be removed in an upcoming release.
